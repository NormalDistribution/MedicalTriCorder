Medical TriCorder
================

The Medical TriCorder is written in Python and interfaces with an arduino powered Hand Scanner Unit (HSU). The software for the Medical TriCorder is designed to run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and the Raspberry Pi.

Please keep in mind all code and schematics are PRE-ALPHA.

The goal of the Medical TriCorder is to create a fast, efficent, and open source way to quickly get the core vitals of a patient.

The HSU is the main device of this project and will gather Beats Per Minute, SpO2, and Tempature of a patient and transmit it back to the TriCorder application for easy readout.
